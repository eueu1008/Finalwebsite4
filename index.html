    <span>By the 1960s, even popular artworks of the Abstract Expressionists of the 1940s and  <br/>'50s had become cliche. Warhol was one of the artists that felt the need to bring <br/> back imagery into his work. The gallery owner and interior designer Muriel Latow  <br/>gave Warhol the idea of painting soup cans, and suggested him to paint objects that  <br/>people use every day. Â Warhol then began to recreate images found in advertising. <br/> He recreated images of products found in supermarkets in his canvas. Warhol is <br/> highly respected to this day for creating a new type of art that both complemented  <br/>and criticized the consumption habits. Andy Warhols Campbells Soup Cans series <br/> are most well-known images of American modern art. Warhol created as a series of  <br/>thirty two canvases and the soup cans gained international fame. Though they <br/> seemed identical to the products in real life,  slight variations appeared  in the  <br/>lettering and in the hand-stamped fluer-de-lis symbols on the bottom of each soup  <br/>can.
